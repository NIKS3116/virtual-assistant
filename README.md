# virtual-assistant
Virtual Assistant what if we could have our Virtual Assistant similar to Siri, google assistant in your android device but according to your taste and needs. We all know that Siri, Google assistant have their prerequisites so I wanted to develop it according to our tastes and needs. For the execution of this, I'm gonna make use of Android Studio and code majorly in java.
